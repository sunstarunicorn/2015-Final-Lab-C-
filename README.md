# 2015-Final-Lab-C-
This was the final lab in my Advanced C++ Programming class, which had no final projects.

If I remember correctly, this lab was meant to be a custom built priority queue.  Our teacher liked to teach us about C++ by having us craft our own versions of already existing classes and functions.

As I've said on all my other GitHub projects thus far, I'm a raw beginner with GitHub and thus only the code files are uploaded with no real style or finesse.
